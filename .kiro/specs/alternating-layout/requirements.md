# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a consistent alternating left-right layout pattern across all pages of the portfolio website. Each page will have multiple content sections that alternate between default (left-aligned content, right-aligned visuals) and reverse (right-aligned content, left-aligned visuals) layouts to create visual rhythm and engagement.

2. WHEN the first section loads THEN the system SHALL use the default layout (content left, visuals right)
3. WHEN the second section loads THEN the system SHALL use the reverse layout (content right, visuals left)
4. WHEN subsequent sections load THEN the system SHALL continue alternating between default and reverse layouts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor on a mobile device, I want the alternating layout to work well on small screens, so that the content remains readable and visually appealing.

3. WHEN on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing and typography
4. WHEN transitioning between breakpoints THEN the system SHALL smoothly adapt the layout

### Requirement 3

1. WHEN implementing alternating layouts THEN the system SHALL provide reusable CSS classes or components
2. WHEN creating new sections THEN the system SHALL allow easy application of alternating patterns
3. WHEN building pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency in spacing, typography, and visual elements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing between alternating sections
2. WHEN content is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent typography hierarchy
3. WHEN visual elements are shown THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling for cards, images, and interactive elements
4. WHEN animations are applied THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions that enhance the alternating pattern

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want each page to have at least 3 sections with alternating layouts, so that I can experience the full visual rhythm of the design pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the homepage THEN the system SHALL display at least 3 sections with alternating layouts
2. WHEN I visit the about page THEN the system SHALL display at least 3 sections with alternating layouts
