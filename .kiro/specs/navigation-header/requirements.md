# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a responsive top navigation header for the portfolio website that provides easy access to different sections of the site. The header will be implemented as reusable components following modern React patterns and will integrate seamlessly with the existing SCSS design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see a clear navigation header at the top of the page, so that I can easily navigate to different sections of the portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a fixed header at the top of the viewport
2. WHEN the header is displayed THEN the system SHALL show navigation links for About, Contact, Projects, and Experience
3. WHEN the viewport width is desktop size THEN the system SHALL display all navigation items horizontally
4. WHEN the header is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the existing design tokens and glassmorphism styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor using a mobile device, I want the navigation to be accessible and usable on small screens, so that I can navigate the site effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is below tablet breakpoint THEN the system SHALL display a hamburger menu icon
2. WHEN the hamburger menu is clicked THEN the system SHALL show/hide the navigation menu
3. WHEN the mobile menu is open THEN the system SHALL display navigation items vertically
4. WHEN the mobile menu is open THEN the system SHALL prevent body scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the header to be built with reusable components, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows React best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the header THEN the system SHALL create separate components for Header, Navigation, and MobileMenu
2. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL use proper component composition patterns
3. WHEN building components THEN the system SHALL implement proper prop interfaces and TypeScript types
4. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow the existing project structure and naming conventions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want visual feedback when interacting with navigation elements, so that I understand which actions are available and what I'm currently viewing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over navigation links THEN the system SHALL provide visual hover effects
2. WHEN a navigation item corresponds to the current page section THEN the system SHALL highlight it as active
3. WHEN navigation items are focused via keyboard THEN the system SHALL show focus indicators
4. WHEN animations are applied THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions consistent with the design system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the navigation to work with smooth scrolling to page sections, so that I can quickly jump to relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a navigation link is clicked THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the corresponding page section
2. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the system SHALL update the active navigation state based on the current section
3. WHEN smooth scrolling is implemented THEN the system SHALL respect user's motion preferences
4. IF a section doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
